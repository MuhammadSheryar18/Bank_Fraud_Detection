### ** Case Study Questions:**
1. **What are the top 10 largest transactions in the database?**
2. **Which accounts have the most frequent transactions in the last 30 days?**
3. **What is the average transaction amount by transaction type (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer)?**
4. **Which transactions were made from locations that differ from the account holder's usual location?**
5. **What percentage of transactions were performed from mobile devices vs. ATMs?**
6. **Which devices have been used for transactions outside the usual geographical regions of the account holders?**
